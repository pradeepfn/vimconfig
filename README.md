###cscope

vim does not add the cscope.out file as a database by default. use the following in
.vimrc file
```bash
if has("cscope")
        set csprg=/usr/bin/cscope
        set csto=0
        set cst 
        set nocsverb
        " add any database in current directory
        if filereadable("cscope.out")
            cs add cscope.out
        " else add database pointed to by environment
        elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
            cs add $CSCOPE_DB
        endif
